## I'm new to Tailwind CSS, Is Oxywind right for me?

If you are totally new to Tailwind CSS, it might not be the best idea to jump right into the Oxywind as your first step - grasp the basics then take the Oxwind!

## How does Oxywind compare to CORE CSS framework?

CORE CSS framework is a CSS framework by the OxyNinja team and wrapped into Oxygen Builder-specified WordPress plugins. Oxyninja also offer design sets or section based on the CORE CSS framework.

Oxywind on the other hand provides a solution to integrate Tailwind CSS (one of the first original CSS frameworks which came out quite some time ago) to Oxygen Builder, not a brand new CSS framework.

## How does Oxywind compare to Oxymade Framework?

OxyMade framework is based on Tailwind CSS v2.0 while Oxywind is running the latest version of Tailwind CSS (v3.0). Oxymade also builds a bunch of design sets or templates based on the OxyMade framework.

Oxywind on the other hand provides a solution to integrate Tailwind CSS (one of the first original CSS frameworks which came out quite some time ago) to Oxygen Builder, not a brand new CSS framework.

## How does Oxywind compare to Automaticcss?

Automaticcss is just a new utitilty-first CSS framework.

Oxywind on the other hand provides a solution to integrate Tailwind CSS (one of the first original CSS frameworks which came out quite some time ago) to Oxygen Builder, not a brand new CSS framework.

## Does Oxywind compete or as a replacement for the CORE CSS framework, OxyMade Framework, Automaticcss?

Oxywind is a solution to integrate Tailwind CSS (one of the first original CSS frameworks which came out quite some time ago) to Oxygen Builder, not a brand new CSS framework.

So, Oxywind is not competing or as a replacement for the CORE CSS framework, OxyMade Framework, and Automaticcss.
They compete with Tailwind CSS, not Oxywind.
